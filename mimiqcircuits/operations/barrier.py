class Barrier(Operation):
    """Barrier operation.

    A barrier is a special operation that does not affect the quantum state or
    the execution of a circuit, but it prevents compression or optimization
    operation from being applied across it.

    Examples:

        Adding Barrier operation to the Circuit (The args can be: range, list,
        tuple, set or int)

        >>> from mimiqcircuits import *
        >>> c= Circuit()
        >>> c.push(Barrier(1), 1)
        2-qubit circuit with 1 instructions:
        └── Barrier @ q[1]
        <BLANKLINE>

        >>> from mimiqcircuits import *
        >>> c= Circuit()
        >>> c.push(Barrier(1), range(0,4))
        4-qubit circuit with 4 instructions:
        ├── Barrier @ q[0]
        ├── Barrier @ q[1]
        ├── Barrier @ q[2]
        └── Barrier @ q[3]
        <BLANKLINE>

        Adding Barrier to the circuit as a multi-qubits gate

        >>> from mimiqcircuits import *
        >>> c= Circuit()
        >>> c.push(Barrier(5),1,2,3,4,5)
        6-qubit circuit with 1 instructions:
        └── Barrier @ q[1,2,3,4,5]
