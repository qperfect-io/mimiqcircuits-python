MIMIQ Circuits
##############

MIMIQ Circuits is a quantum computing framework and high performance simulator
developed by QPerfect that allows you to develop and run your quantum
algorithms beyond the limits of today's noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ)
computers.

.. _alpha-release:

Alpha Release
=============

MIMIQ Circuits is currently in the alpha stage and open to test for early
adopters. We are continuously refining and enhance our tools so we value any
feedback you may have to ensure that MIMIQ Circuits meets and exceeds your
expectations. If you want access to MIMIQ Circuits, we encourage you register
on `our website <https://qperfect.io/index.php/mimiq-circuits>`__.

Embark on this quantum computing journey with us during the beta stage of MIMIQ
Circuits, and take part in the large scale quantum revolution!
