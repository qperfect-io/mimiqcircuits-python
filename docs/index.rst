Introduction
============

MIMIQ Circuits is a quantum computing framework and high performance simulator
developed by QPerfect. It allows you to develop and run your quantum
algorithms beyond the limits of today's noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ)
computers.

Quick Start
-----------

:file:`mimiqcircuits.py` is a `Python Language <https://docs.python.org/3/>`_ package containing all the utilities and programming interfaces (APIs) 
 to build quantum systems, connect, and execute simulations on `QPerfect's MIMIQ-CIRC <https://qperfect.io/>`_ 
 large-scale quantum circuit simulator.

To install :file:`mimiqcircuits.py` you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install "mimiqcircuits @ git+https://github.com/qperfect-io/mimiqcircuits-python.git"


For more details on installation, please refer to the :ref:`installation` page.
