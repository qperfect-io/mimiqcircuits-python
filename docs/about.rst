MIMIQ Circuits uses highly efficient compression schemes to exactly simulate
large quantum circuits with hundreds of qubits and provides approximate
simulations for high entanglement circuits exceeding NISQ performance. It is
ideal for learning how to design more complex quantum algorithms, optimizing
quantum protocols to take full advantage of next generation hardware and for
moving towards a quantum advantage in your quantum applications.


Computing Paradigm
==================

At QPerfect, we strive to seamlessly integrate with your existing workflows. We
provide user-friendly Julia or Python libraries that enable you to construct
quantum circuits and connect to our remote services. Regardless of whether you
prefer scripting, Jupyter notebooks, or Pluto notebooks, our approach ensures a
fast and frictionless experience.


How It Works
============

Using MIMIQ Circuits is a straightforward process. You can leverage our
open-source libraries to connect to our remote services and unlock the full
potential of quantum circuit simulations. Here's a high-level overview of the
process:

* **Circuit Design**: Leverage our comprehensive libraries to construct
  intricate quantum circuits effortlessly. Our libraries offer a set of
  functions and tools for defining and manipulating quantum circuits.

* **Job Request**: Once your circuit is ready, submit a job request to our
  remote services using the Python or [Julia](/docs/julia/) libraries.
  This request contains the circuit information along with any specific
  simulation parameters.

* **Simulation and Execution**: Our robust remote infrastructure takes charge
  and performs the quantum circuit simulation using powerful cloud based
  computational resources.

* **Result Retrieval**: After the simulation completes, you can retrieve the
  results through the [Julia](/docs/julia/)/Python libraries or via a
  web interface.
